<h2>Introduction</h2> 

WordPress Mobile Pack is **supported on** iOS and Android smartphones and tablets. **Compatible browsers**: Safari, Google Chrome, Android - Native Browser. The plugin has been tested on WordPress 3.6 and later. Please read the [Known issues and limitations](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-mobile-pack/other_notes/) list before installing.

What the WordPress Mobile Pack 3.0+ enables you to do:

* **Progressive Web Apps**. Some of the key features of progressive web apps are: (1) Apps load nearly instantly and are reliable, no matter what kind of network connection your user is on; (2) Web app install banners give users the ability to quickly and seamlessly add your mobile app to their home screen, making it easy to launch and return to your app; (3) Web push notifications makes it easy to re-engage with users by showing relevant, timely, and contextual notifications, even when the browser is closed; (4) Smooth animations, scrolling, and navigations keep the experience silky smooth; (5) Secured via HTTPS;
 (6) Responsive UI.

* **Responsive UI**. The mobile web application is sensitive to various screen sizes and orientation changes: landscape, portrait. In other words, the look and feel of the mobile web app seamlessly morphs into the screen size of users' devices.

* **App Themes**. You can offer your users an exceptional reading experience by giving them a mobile web application with a native app-like look & feel. The default theme comes with 6 abstract covers that are randomly displayed on the loading screen to give the app a magazine flavour. More app themes available in [WordPress Mobile Pack PRO](https://wpmobilepack.com).

* **Customize appearance**. Once a favorite theme has been selected, you can customize the colors & fonts, add your logo and graphic elements that can relate to your blog's identity. More customization options available in [WordPress Mobile Pack PRO](https://wpmobilepack.com).

* **Posts Sync**. The articles/posts inside the mobile web application are organized into their corresponding categories, thus readers can simply swipe through articles and jump from category to category in a seamless way.

* **Pages Sync**. Choose what pages you want to display on your mobile web application. You can edit, show/hide different pages and order them according to your needs.

* **Comments Sync**. All the comments that are displayed in the blog are also synchronized into the mobile web application. On top of that, comments that are posted from within the app are also displayed on the blog. Social media features are available in [WordPress Mobile Pack PRO](https://wpmobilepack.com).

* **Analytics**. WordPress Mobile Pack easily integrates with Google Analytics.

* **Add to Homescreen**. Readers can add the mobile web application to their homescreen and run it in full-screen mode.

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2> 

**What is the difference between a progressive web application and a responsive WordPress theme?**

A responsive theme is all about screen-size: it loads the same styling as the desktop view, adjusting it to fit a smaller screen. On the other hand a mobile web application combines the versatility of the web with the functionality of touch-enabled devices and can support native app-like features such as:

1. Apps load nearly instantly and are reliable, no matter what kind of network connection your user is on.
1.  Web app install banners give users the ability to quickly and seamlessly add your mobile app to their home screen, making it easy to launch and return to your app.
1.  Web push notifications makes it easy to re-engage with users by showing relevant, timely, and contextual notifications, even when the browser is closed.
1.  Smooth animations, scrolling, and navigations keep the experience silky Smooth.
1.  Secured via HTTPS.

**Am I able to use my own theme or customize the existing one?**

WordPress Mobile Pack uses a variety of open source JavaScript frameworks from Sencha Touch to Angular/Ionic or React, that mimics a native app interface. Because of that, the app themes we've developed are not regular PHP based themes that can be easily customized by editing the source. It is still possible to make small changes (not recommended), but changing the theme structure will require advance knowledge. We're happy to assist if you're looking for a custom type of application - [please get in touch](https://wpmobilepack.com/contact.html) with us.

**Am I able to add Javascript code inside the theme?**

Adding tracking scripts in the source is possible if you place them in the section of the theme files. However, code that is placed inside the posts will not be executed. The theme is implemented enterily in JavaScript and that would mean JavaScript code inside another JavaScript code.

**Am I able to integrate my own advertisement?**

Google Ad Sense / Google Double Click for Publishers is supported on the PRO version as of v2.1. [Please get in touch](https://wpmobilepack.com/contact.html) if you want us to integrate with another 3rd party ad provider.

**What is a progressive web app?**

Please refer to this comprehensive article about it: https://www.appticles.com/blog/2016/09/progressive-web-apps-for-publishers/.

**Why some 3rd party plugins are not visible on any of the app themes?**

There are almost 50,000 plugins in the WordPress.org repository. It's impossible to support all of them. [Please get in touch](https://wpmobilepack.com/contact.html) if you want us to integrate with another 3rd party plugin.
